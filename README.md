# Python_project

1) Explore the data set and found out that there is no NAN values.
2) We change object values into ordinal values 
3) We want to predict the obesity levels
4) We make visualisation and exploration based on our predictor value : 
    - number of population in each category of obesity level in order to see if each category is well represented 
    - and the distribution of each variable

5) For the project, we chose classification algorithm. We test each of them and compare their score. With our work, we found that the best algorithm is the Gradient Boosting.
6) Django API (how to use it in the powerpoint) to play with some parameters for graphs and Random Forest algorithm.
